This package was built as a translation backend for any service or language
there are 3 basic commands that you must know before using this

`npm run dev` this will run the development server, any changes on the resources/**/*.json files will cause a reload on the app

`npm run build` this will generate the static json files and the production server, you only have to do this when building your app for production

`npm start` or `npm run start` will start the production server, please be aware that this command will result in an error if
you run it without running the `npm run build` before
